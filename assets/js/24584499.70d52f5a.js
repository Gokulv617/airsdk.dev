If you believe anything else should be added, please let us know! \\n\\n\\nThe second is the [Showcase](/showcase) section. The showcase is designed to be a place for AIR developers to not only promote their work but promote the AIR platform and show what is possible using the AIR SDK. You can add your own application through a pull request to the repository (or you can just email me your details).\\n\\nIf you have any feedback on the tutorials or guides we are writing (or if you would like to contribute) please reach out!"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/welcome","source":"@site/news/2021-05-25-welcome.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the new AIR SDK developer portal.","date":"2021-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 25, 2021","tags":[{"label":"airsdk","permalink":"/news/tags/airsdk"}],"readingTime":0.105,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Developer at distriqt","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Community and Showcase Sections","permalink":"/news/2021/10/14/new-additions"}},"content":"Welcome to the new AIR SDK developer portal. \\n\\nThis site is aimed to become the central location for all things AIR."}]}')}}]);
